## Test cases
In order to run the following tests successfully:
- <name_of_file>.java
- <name_of_file>.java
- <name_of_file>.java

We have to change the value of `id` according to the database values in the following code:

This is an example of an ID in these files:
```java
    @Test
    public void TestGetAccountById(){
        Accounts response =accountsService.getAccountById(6);
        Assertions.assertThat(response.getId()).isEqualTo(6);
    }
```

You only need to change the value of the ID corresponding to the database connected, in this example it is `6`
